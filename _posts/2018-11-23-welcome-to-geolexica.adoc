Welcome to Geolexica, the authoritative glossary for geographic
information technology from ISO/TC 211.

The name "`geolexica`" is the combination of the Greek prefix "`geo-`"
(of and pertaining to the Earth) and the suffix "`lexica`"
derived from Greek "`lexiko`", the counterpart of English "`lexicon`"
(vocabulary).

Terms on this site are managed by the ISO/TC 211 Terminology Management Group (TMG).
The TMG can be contacted at its Chair, Reese Plews.
