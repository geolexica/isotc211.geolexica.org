Welcome to Geolexica, the authoritative glossary for geographic
information technology from ISO/TC 211.

The name "`geolexica`" is the combination of the Greek prefix "`geo-`"
(of and pertaining to the Earth) and the suffix "`lexica`"
derived from Greek "`lexiko`", the counterpart of English "`lexicon`"
(vocabulary).

Management Group (TMG). The Chair of the TMG is Reese Plews.
