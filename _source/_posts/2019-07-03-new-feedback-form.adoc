Due to popular request at the ISO/TC 211 Plenary at Maribor,
we have now added a link:/feedback[feedback form]
for collection of feedback: whether it is to do with ISO/TC 211 MLGT,
the Geolexica platform, or just comments (aka kudos) to the TMG.

The TMG will periodically review these messages. You may be contacted
shall any resulting updates occur or communication be necessary, so
make sure you provide a correct email address!
