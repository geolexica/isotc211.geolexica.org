= Technical Report: Geolexica now has Reverse Semantic Search

== Introduction

Ever forgotten a specific word but could describe its meaning?

Internet search engines more than often return unrelated entries.
The solution is *reverse semantic search*: given an input of the meaning of the
word (search phrase), provide an output with dictionary words that match the
meaning.
The key to accurate reverse search lies in the machine's ability to understand
semantics.
We employ deep learning approaches in natural language processing (NLP) to
enable better comparison of meanings between the search phrases with word
definitions.
Accuracy will be significantly increased.
The project outcome will be employed on Geolexica as a pilot application and
testbed for evaluation.
The ability to identify entities with similar semantics facilitates ontology
discovery in the Semantic Web and in Technical Language Processing (TLP).

== Deliverables

Deliverable 1:: Synthetic testing dataset (attached under https://github.com/geolexica/breviter/tree/main/public/test_cases[`public/test_cases`^] in https://github.com/geolexica/breviter[^])

Deliverable 2:: The search engine implementation (https://isotc211.geolexica.org/_next/server/pages/reverse.html[^])

Deliverable 3:: Geolexica application (refer to Deliverable 2)

Deliverable 4:: Testing and benchmarking (results <<test-results,detailed below>>)

== Evaluation method

=== Overview

A overall fit score (normalized) is calculated for each test dataset and search method.

This score is then used for comparison in the evaluation phase.

The higher the score, the more accurate the result is.

The score is ranged from 0 to 1.

=== Test Methodology and Score Calculation

==== Dataset Format

Each dataset is a plaintext file,
each row consisting of a query string,
followed by a comma,
followed by the expected result.

==== Test Methodology

For each combination of dataset and search method,
for each query in the dataset,
feed it into the search method,
and receive an ordered list of output words.

The order of the expected word within the list is the resulting *rank*,
which is used to calculate the aggregate score for the dataset and search method
combination.

The aggregate scores are then normalized against the dataset size.
These normalized scores are compared with each other in order to
compare relative accuracy.
The higher the score (closer to 1.0),
the more accurate the search method is, for the given dataset.

==== Aggregate Score

It is a weighted arithmetic mean of the number of inputs achieving a certain
rank range, multiplied by the corresponding score:

- A, *rank 1:*  score 20
- B, *rank 2-3:*  score 10
- C, *rank 4-5:*  score 5
- D, *rank 6-10:*  score 3
- E, *rank 11+:*  score 1

normalized score = (20×A + 10×B + 5×C + 3×D + 1×E) / (20 × (A + B + C + D + E))
